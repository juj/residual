	 * how our primary backend, the SDL one, does it on many systems), we
	 * still have to do mutex syncing in our timer callbacks.
	 * In addition, the sound mixer uses a mutex in case the backend runs it
	 * from a dedicated thread (as e.g. the SDL backend does).
	 *
	 * Hence backends which do not use threads to implement the timers simply
	 * can use dummy implementations for these methods.
